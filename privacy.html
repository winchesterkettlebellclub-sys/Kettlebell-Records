    <h2>Who runs this site</h2>
    <p>
      This website is a personal / community-run project maintained by volunteers. It is not a commercial service.
      For contact or data requests please use the website <a href="/contact.html">contact form</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal data we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Competition-related data submitted by organisers or competitors via the submission form (names, lifts, weights, categories, age groups, nationalities, and related performance data).</li>
      <li>Contact form submissions (name, email, message) when you use the contact form on the website.</li>
      <li>Technical information (IP address, browser user agent) only where necessary for spam protection or if you explicitly interact with administrative features — we do not use comprehensive tracking by default.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use your data</h2>
    <p>We use the data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>publish competition results and record lists,</li>
      <li>respond to contact enquiries, bulk upload requests or correction requests, and</li>
      <li>operate basic spam- and abuse-protection on form submissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where data is stored</h2>
    <p>
      Results and form submissions are stored using Google services (Google Forms and Google Sheets) and are published via
      the public "publish to web" feature. By submitting data you accept that the relevant data will be made available in the
      published views used on this site.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal basis</h2>
    <p>
      Where applicable we rely on legitimate interests for publishing event results (this is the common expectation for sports results),
      and consent where specific optional processing (e.g. analytics) is used. Contact form processing is performed to respond to your enquiry.
    </p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Published results are kept as an archive on the site. Contact form messages will be retained for up to 24 months unless you request deletion sooner.
      If you need data removed, please contact us using the <a href="/contact.html">contact form</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies and analytics</h2>
    <p>
      The site uses only minimal cookies required for forms and basic operation. Optional analytics are only enabled with explicit consent.
      The site includes a cookie-consent banner where you can opt in or decline optional tracking.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      We embed Google Forms and Google Sheets for data collection and publication. Their use of data is subject to Google's privacy policies:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      You may request access to your personal data, request correction or deletion, or object to processing where applicable.
      To exercise your rights, use the <a href="/contact.html">contact form</a> and we will respond. You may also contact the ICO if you wish to lodge a complaint.
