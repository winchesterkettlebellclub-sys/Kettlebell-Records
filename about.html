    <h1>About this project</h1>

    <p>
      This website publishes kettlebell sport competition results, ranks and records as a free community resource.
      It is a personal / community project run by volunteers — not a commercial service — created to help athletes,
      organisers and national bodies find results in one place.
    </p>

    <h2>What we publish</h2>
    <p>
      We publish competitor names, lifts, weights, categories, age groups and nationalities as supplied by event organisers
      or submitted via the online submission form. Where contributors provide bulk data we attempt to review and publish it
      accurately and promptly.
    </p>

    <h2>How to get in touch</h2>
    <p>
      Please use the website contact form for enquiries, corrections and bulk upload requests:
      <a href="contact.html">Contact form</a>.
      If you are sending bulk data, include a short description of the file format and contact details — we will reply with
      instructions for secure transfer where necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Volunteers and updates</h2>
    <p>
      The site is maintained by volunteers in their spare time. We aim to keep the site up to date, but changes and updates
      may take a short while depending on availability. If something looks wrong, please report it using the contact form.
